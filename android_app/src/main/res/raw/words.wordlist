it's an emergency
it's been a slice
it's been real
it's cold outside
it's five o'clock somewhere
it's going
it's no use
it's none of your business
it's not a bug, it's a feature
it's not even funny
it's not every day
it's not my fault
it's not the size of the ship, it's the motion of the ocean
it's not you, it's me
it's nothing
it's on
it's only a matter of time
it's raining
it's snowing
it's someone's funeral
it's the truth, Ruth
it's too expensive
it's too late for sorry
it's what's inside that counts
